### Hi, I am Qingzheng ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student with a deep passion for the evolving field of Computer Science, actively seeking to further my education through a graduate degree.

ðŸ“š My academic and research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, AI, machine learning, and data mining â€” where I enjoy exploring how these technologies can unravel complex data patterns and enhance human-AI interaction.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am immersed in my bachelor's thesis in astrophysics, but I'm always open for a friendly chit-chat!

ðŸ”Š Pronunciation of my name if you want to give it a try: Ching-Jeng.
